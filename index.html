        <h2>Graphic Designer</h2>

        <p>Hi! I'm Susan and I am a Graphic Designer and Web Developer.  I am new to the field, but learning very quickly and really suprising myself with how much I enjoy writing HTML code and utilizing CSS.  I am getting more comfortable with the suite of Adobe products and would say that so far; Indesign is my favorite.</p>

          <h3>Magazine Cover</h3>
          <img src="images/CactusFancy.jpg" alt="Cover of a Magazine About Cacti">
          <p>I designed this cover for a project on creative magazine covers.  I am also very interested in cats and horiculture, so I thought it would be fun to take some liberties with the Cat Fancy magazine and some cringe worthy cacti puns.</p>
